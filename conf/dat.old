        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Cracow Cognitive Science Conference (CCSC) was founded with the goal of promoting cognitive science among Polish students from various fields. The first edition was held on May 26-27, 2007, under the theme Towards Artificial Intelligence, with Professor Jerzy Perzanowski serving as research supervisor. </p>
        <p>In April 2008, the second edition explored the concept of ‘the lost paradigm’, featuring renowned guests such as Professors Jerzy Vetulani and Edward Nęcka, who both delivered keynote lectures. </p>
        <p>The third edition in March 2009 was held at the Jagiellonian University Main Library, where the topics evolved around language through the lenses of cognitive science. </p>
        <p>The fourth edition, titled In the Shadow of Blooming Anomalies, took place in May 2010. This edition was the first to establish a scientific committee and focused on cognitive science’s exploration of deviations from the norm. </p>
        <p>The fifth edition, held in April 2011 under the theme Towards Practice, was the last to feature an organizational committee made up not only of cognitive science students, but also students from other faculties. A special guest was Professor Barbara Tversky. </p>
        <p>Starting from the 2014 edition, the Cognitive Science Students' Association assumed full responsibility for organizing the event. The sixth edition took place at the Jagiellonian University Institute of Philosophy and focused on the topic of the senses. </p>
        <p>In April 2015, the seventh edition was held at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University. The main theme of the edition was Language. What is interesting is that the event was uniquely promoted through a theatrical performance by the organizing committee. </p>
        <p>The eighth edition in March 2016 revolved around Intelligence, featuring a special pre-conference lecture by Dr. Flavia Filimon, along with four other keynote speakers. </p>
        <p>The ninth edition, held in April 2017, for the first time introduced workshops alongside lectures and focused on the topic of Consciousness. </p>
        <p>For the first time, the 10th anniversary conference in 2018 was held entirely in English. The event honored Professor Jerzy Perzanowski's contribution to cognitive science in Poland with the introduction of the Jerzy Perzanowski Awards for the best master’s and PhD theses. </p>
        <p>The 11th edition, held in May 2019, discussed Attention and Memory and featured Professors Robert H. J. van der Lubbe and Juan Lupiáñez as keynote speakers. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the 12th edition, scheduled for May 2020, was canceled due to the global pandemic. </p>
        <p>The 13th edition took place online in May 2022, with the theme 4E: Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Extended. </p>
        <p>The Cracow Cognitive Science Conference is an event organized by Cognitive Science Students' Association and friends from Jagiellonian University. Each year, the conference addresses a different interdisciplinary topic, fostering scientific exchange and collaboration across the cognitive sciences. </p>
        <p>As we prepare for the 14th edition, we aim to continue this tradition of bringing together specialists from diverse areas of cognitive science, building on the legacy of those who organized the event in previous years. </p>
